\textbf{Consider the 3 player game shown below, in which player3’s strategy set is ${M1,M2,M3,M4}$. Each cell only lists one payoff, which represents all three players’ payoffs from that strategy profile. E.g., all three players’ payoff is 8 from $(A, C, M_1)$.}
\bigbreak

\textbf{Let $p \in [0, 1]$ denote the probability of playing $A$ in a mixed strategy for player 1 (so $1 - p$ is the probability of playing B), and $q \in [0, 1]$ denote that of playing $C$ in a mixed strategy for player 2 (so $1 - q$ is the probability of playing D). We can denote a mixed strategy profile for players 1 and 2 by a pair $(p, q)$.}

I expect there's a positive correlation between sales of cigarettes and Age, because the people with higher ages tend to smoke more cigarettes, the proportion of people smoking within young people is relatively small.\par
I expect there's a negative correlation between sales of cigarettes and HS, because people with higher education are more aware of the harm of smoking and are tend to somke less.\par
I expect there's a positive correlation between sales of cigarettes and Income, because with more money, people can afford more cigarettes.\par
I don't expect there's a correlation between sales of cigarettes and Black, because there's no supporting evidence that black people are mode likely to smoke more than others.\par
I expect there's a negative correlation between sales of cigarettes and Female, because there are a lot more men smoking than women, the higher the proportion of the women, the less the proportion of people smoking.\par
I expect there's a negative correlation between sales of cigarettes and Price, the less the price is, the more people can afford the cigarettes.\par

\textbf{Players 1 and 2 are bargaining over \$10. Each player $i$ names an amount, $s_i$, between 0 and 10 for herself. These numbers do not have to be in whole dollar units. The choices are made simultaneously. Each player’s payoff is equal to her own monetary payoff . We will consider this game under two different rules. In both cases, if $s_1 + s_2 \leq 10$ then the players get the amounts that they named (and the remainder, if any, is destroyed).}
